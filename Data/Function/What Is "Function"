Function
- Description: Represents a block of code that can be executed. Functions are first-class values in Lua, meaning they can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, and returned by other functions.
- Example:
local 
function var()
print("Hello Lua, I am Iren")
end

var()
===> Output: Hello Lua, I am Iren

print(type(var))
===> Output: function
